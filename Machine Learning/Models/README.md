<h3> This directory contains all about our models exploration. We had trained for about 6 models, namely VGG16, MobileNet, InceptionV3, Xception, EfficientNet, and CNN. However, due to GitHub file size limitation, some of the files won't be pushed here, instead we will give the Google Drive link access. </h3>

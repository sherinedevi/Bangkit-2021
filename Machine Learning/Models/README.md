# ML Model
<h3> This directory contains all about our models exploration. </h3>
<br> We had trained for about 6 models. The training process uses train and validation set, while for the testing process, we apply them on the test set taken from the CNRPark dataset. Here are the results: <br>
  1. Inception with 91% accuracy on test set <br>
  2. EfficientNetB3 with 98% accuracy on test set <br>
  3. EfficientNetB4 with 98.8% accuracy on test set <br>
  4. Mobile Net with 95% accuracy on test set <br>
  5. VGG16 with 98.4% accuracy on test set <br>
  6. Xception with 97.5% accuracy on test set <br>
  7. CNN with 96.9% accuracy on test set <br>

## Saved Model <br>
Due to GitHub file size limitation, some of the files won't be pushed here, instead we will give the Google Drive link access. <br>
Saved Model can be accessed through this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1chNc4iyEDLxls5hnLXQEJA4KquQFc6vi?usp=sharing. All models are in .h5 format. </br>

## Result on Real Implementation <br>
Moreover, we applied all our models to the real implementation using Indonesian CCTV footage on a police station's parking lot. The result (can be found [here](https://github.com/sherinedevi/Bangkit-2021-Capstone-Project/tree/main/Machine%20Learning/Models/Result))
